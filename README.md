## License: CERN Open Hardware Licence v1.2

Mounting adapter for active IR detector remote sensor

  Designed for the Rolm RPR-220-photoreflector or equivalent IR transmitter/Detector


  * Drill a hole under the track / between the rails for the detector sensor 
  * Measure the roadbed depth and solder the sensor to the mounting plate such that the sensor does not extend up past the ties
  * solder a 4x wire harness - or a 1x4 header - to the mount, with the pins/wires facing down / away from the sensor
  * Use a screw to attach the mount under the layout
